When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I want to share the code I have created with team/ community
  When I am working on community projects
  When I want to create a backup for my code

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  It may not be possible to always be online connected to GitHub
  You dont want to publish content that you have created for trial
  You want to publish braches which are finalized and not extra clutter
